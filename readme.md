# Test pose estimate

# Method overview
## AlphaPose
  + **AlphaPose** is an accurate multi-person pose estimator.
  + Apr 2019: MXNet version of AlphaPose is released! It runs at 23 fps on COCO validation set.
  + Sep 2018: PyTorch version of AlphaPose is released! It runs at 20 fps on COCO validation set (4.6 people per image on average) and achieves 71 mAP!

## OpenPose
  + [github_link](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose)
  + Hard to build (C++)
  + ![open_pose_competition](images/openpose_vs_competition.png)
  + Performance with less person < alphapose.
